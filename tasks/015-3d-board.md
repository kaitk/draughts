# 015: The 3D board

Status: todo

A 3D board from the same game state (`docs/product.md`, after the MVP: Looks), on the
title menu first and as a setting for play. Start simple: the board floats in front of
the season's scene with a soft shadow under it, with no room or table to model
([rendering](../docs/architecture/rendering.md#scene-and-glass)). The scene photographs
already exist (task 014 sharpens them).

## Later, only if the floating board falls short

- **A painted backdrop and a real table.** The camera barely moves (about 50° down), so a
  full 360° sphere isn't needed: one blurred backplate of a room or forest, made for a
  fixed camera, and a table mesh in the foreground with a generated wood texture. A
  sphere only if the camera comes to orbit.
- **The look of the 3D design board**, studied 2026-11-07:
  - Light: a warm key from the upper left and behind, short soft shadows to the lower
    right, a cool ambient fill, rim highlights on the pieces' top bevels, a low-contrast
    warm grade.
  - Board: veneer squares (light maple with fine straight grain, dark walnut with wavier
    figure), each square its own grain sample, thin dark seams, a satin finish (roughness
    about 0.5); the playing surface recessed inside a dark inlay border.
  - Frame: cherry or oak with a rounded bullnose edge, its grain following each side,
    about 1/18 of the board's width.
  - Pieces: cream and matte (about `#f1ddb8`), height about 22% of the diameter, rounded
    edges, a recessed inner disc at about 65% of the radius with a raised lip; dark
    pieces walnut and a little glossier. A king is two discs with a visible seam and the
    crown debossed in its face.
  - Shading: a contact shadow ring at each piece's base and along the inner frame edge;
    the selection an emissive ring on the board, targets emissive dots.
  - Camera about 50° down, field of view 30 to 35°, the background blurred.
- **How to draw it cheaply**: forward rendering with one directional light and an ambient
  taken from the background; one soft shadow map for the pieces (the board is static);
  analytic disc shadows instead of SSAO, with occlusion baked into the meshes; lathe
  meshes for pieces and an extruded frame profile; procedural wood (ring distance plus
  turbulence) into an albedo, roughness, and normal atlas at build time or startup;
  GGX specular with wrap diffuse; glows as additive decals, no bloom pass; a mild
  tonemap.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] The 3D board drawn natively from the game state, floating in front of the scene
      with a soft shadow, with the theme's colors and the key light
- [ ] Taps hit the right squares through the perspective
- [ ] Draws nothing while idle, as the 2D board
