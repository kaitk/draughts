# 015: The 3D board

Status: todo

A 3D board from the same game state (`docs/product.md`, after the MVP: Looks), on the
title menu first and as a setting for play. Start simple: the board floats in front of
the season's scene with a soft shadow under it, with no room or table to model
([rendering](../docs/architecture/rendering.md#scene-and-glass)). The scene photographs
already exist (task 014 sharpens them).

## Prototype first (the user, 2026-11-08)

A small prototype before anything in the app: one program, the board and a fixed
position, a camera that a drag can turn for inspection, nothing of the shell. It should
look good, not merely work.

- **Where:** native Goose and goose_gfx on the Mac (`poc/3d/`, as `poc/` keeps task 001's
  and 005's programs), so its shaders and passes are what ships and it runs on the
  tablet early to measure. Not WebGL: nothing of it would carry over.
- **The look:** the 3D reference (`~/Downloads/ChatGPT Image Nov 7, 2026, 08_19_31
  PM.png`, `agents/design.md`) and the close-ups beside it: good materials (wood, the
  pieces' satin and gloss), specular where it belongs, soft shadows and self-shadowing
  (the pieces' lips and the crown's deboss), ambient occlusion, and antialiasing.
- **No temporal effects** (no TAA, no temporal accumulation or upscaling): the best
  that a single frame can do. The app draws only on change, so a static frame must be
  clean by itself, with nothing to converge.
- **Methods to weigh in the prototype**, measured on the tablet:
  - Ambient occlusion: a modern SSAO (GTAO-style, with a spatial-only denoise) against
    the analytic disc and frame occlusion planned below. The geometry is known exactly
    (discs on a plane), so analytic is exact and cheaper; SSAO earns its place only for
    detail analytic misses.
  - Antialiasing: MSAA 4× (cheap on the tablet's tile-based GPU, resolved in tile
    memory), with specular antialiasing (roughness widened by the normal's variance) so
    highlights don't shimmer.
  - Shadows: a soft shadow map (PCF or PCSS) for the pieces, drawn only when the position
    changes, since the scene is static between moves.
  - Few full-screen passes: mobile GPUs pay for bandwidth, not math.
- **Code and methods reference:** Spartan Engine (github.com/PanosK92/SpartanEngine, open
  source, C++) for clear rendering code and current methods; a desktop engine with
  global effects, so its ideas, not its frame structure. The bar: Carmack should be
  pleased, not horrified. Flat data, fixed buffers, nothing allocated per frame, every
  pass justified by a measurement.
- The user has more to add before it starts.

## Later, only if the floating board falls short

- **A painted backdrop and a real table.** The camera barely moves (about 50° down), so a
  full 360° sphere isn't needed: one blurred backplate of a room or forest, made for a
  fixed camera, and a table mesh in the foreground with a generated wood texture. A
  sphere only if the camera comes to orbit.
- **The look of the 3D design board**, studied 2026-11-07:
  - Light: a warm key from the upper left and behind, short soft shadows to the lower
    right, a cool ambient fill, rim highlights on the pieces' top bevels, a low-contrast
    warm grade.
  - Board: veneer squares (light maple with fine straight grain, dark walnut with wavier
    figure), each square its own grain sample, thin dark seams, a satin finish (roughness
    about 0.5); the playing surface recessed inside a dark inlay border.
  - Frame: cherry or oak with a rounded bullnose edge, its grain following each side,
    about 1/18 of the board's width.
  - Pieces: cream and matte (about `#f1ddb8`), height about 22% of the diameter, rounded
    edges, a recessed inner disc at about 65% of the radius with a raised lip; dark
    pieces walnut and a little glossier. A king is two discs with a visible seam and the
    crown debossed in its face.
  - Shading: a contact shadow ring at each piece's base and along the inner frame edge;
    the selection an emissive ring on the board, targets emissive dots.
  - Camera about 50° down, field of view 30 to 35°, the background blurred.
- **How to draw it cheaply**: forward rendering with one directional light and an ambient
  taken from the background; one soft shadow map for the pieces (the board is static);
  analytic disc shadows instead of SSAO, with occlusion baked into the meshes; lathe
  meshes for pieces and an extruded frame profile; procedural wood (ring distance plus
  turbulence) into an albedo, roughness, and normal atlas at build time or startup;
  GGX specular with wrap diffuse; glows as additive decals, no bloom pass; a mild
  tonemap.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] The 3D board drawn natively from the game state, floating in front of the scene
      with a soft shadow, with the theme's colors and the key light
- [ ] Taps hit the right squares through the perspective
- [ ] Draws nothing while idle, as the 2D board
